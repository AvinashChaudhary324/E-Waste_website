    <h1>Solution</h1>
    <div class="para">
        <p>E-waste is the most exponentially growing category of waste but the good thing about it is that it can be recycled almost upto 100% and still the condition is not at alarming rate but as per it's growth it's not even far from that condition. If some important measures are taken from now itself will surely be beneficial in dealing with E-waste on long run. The more time we will waste the more difficult it would be manage the E-waste. <br><br> The following are some possible solutions for managing E-waste:</p>

                <center><h3>Spreading awareness about E-waste:</h3></center>
                <p>
                    The concept of E-waste is still very new to many people mostly in developing countries and rural areas. They don't understand about it and treat it like normal solid waste or other kind of waste which also leads to improper management of E-waste and can be dangerous in some cases. "If we are not aware about the problem, it's impossible to deal with it" , in same way of we don't know what is E-waste we cannot manage it in proper manner. Hence, spreading awareness about E-waste is very important and prior step in solving e-waste problems.

                <p>
                    A dedicated shops for recycling e-waste will be a great initiative and should be controlled by government as it will solve several issues regarding E-waste management such as it will solve the problem of informal E-waste management, will make easy for common people to recycle their E-waste, as it is operated by government it will provide accurate data about the E-waste collected and recycled every year.

               <center><h3>Reusing of electronic devices:</h3></center> 
                <p>
                    As the every week a new device is launcheed with more specifications and affordable prices people now prefer to buy new device insted of repairing their old one. They buy new device and throw the old one before it's lifespan ends . So, instead of throwing the old device they should donate it or sell it to those whom need the devices but not the same high specifications.

                <p>
                    The government should make proper roadmap and design strict laws and programs to increase the rate of recycling e-waste. The government should form a separate committee to spread government's program among common people.

                <center><h3>Use of new technology:</h3></center>
                <p>
                    The growth in technology have lead to increase in E-waste but there are few technologies which can help in reducing the use of electronic devices such as instead of physical storage disk one can use the feature of cloud storage and one of the biggest advantage about it is that the data can be accessed from anywhere and there will be very less chance of losing the data.
